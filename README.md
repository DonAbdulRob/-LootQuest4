Set in an ultra-difficult world full of intricate and one-of-a-kind mechanics, you'll start as a humble peasant with no items, fame or reputation to your name. Struggle your way toward greater strength and conquer. Or, succumb to the environment around you and be conquered.

Features:

-   A lore-rich world with descriptive items and monsters.
-   A traditional turn-based combat system with plenty of items to battle for all kinds of loot.
-   Travel and explore systems to travel to various areas and explore them to experience many unique encounters.
-   Crafting system that involves using materials at town forges to create new items.
-   Shop system to buy items from towns.
-   Spells, abilities, equipment slots and other character customizations.
-   Versatile UI with draggable windows and customizeable color themes.
-   Save and Load Systems to save game progress.
-   And More!

# How to Play

You can follow the build instructions in 'To Build This Project' below to play this game if you are able to download this repo and already have (or are willing to download and install) node/npm. Otherwise, I recommend loading it up using your preferred online development environment. Example, Stackblitz: https://stackblitz.com/github/Destro168/LootQuest3

Troubleshooting Note: If Stackblitz loads but doesn't run the project successfully it may be because of your browser. As of 7/5/2022, webcontainers in Firefox are considered experimental and displayed as such in the Stackblitz online IDE. The recommended fix is to either use a different browser like chrome (tested working) or a different online development environment with easy git imports like CodeSandbox (tested working).

Alternatively, if Stackblitz displays any prompts that could possibly the resolve your issue, the recommendation is to follow them, or try another browser or online ide if those prompts fail to resolve one's issues.
